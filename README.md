### Date

27 & 28 April 2015

### Travel

Flying in to SFO is recommended - GitHub's offices are ~25 mins in a cab (~$50) from the airport. There's also a regular [BART](http://www.bart.gov/guide/airport/outbound_sfo) train from SFO to Mongomery St station which is about 15 mins walk from the GitHub office.

The [Park Central Hotel](http://www.hotels.com/hotel/details.html?tab=description&hotelId=114219&arrivalDate=04-26-15&departureDate=04-28-15&rooms[0].numberOfAdults=2&roomno=1&validate=false&previousDateful=false&reviewOrder=date_newest_first) is within walking distance of the GitHub offices and currently has a very good rate available (~$200/night). Assuming we're paying your expenses (you should know if we are) then we'll cover up to $300 per night (including tax).

We'll provide breakfast, lunch and dinner on Monday (27th) and breakfast and lunch on Tuesday (28th). Please let us know if you have any dietary preferences.
